**Waterfall:

           Structure: A linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
           Use Case: Suitable for projects with clear, unchanging requirements. For example, government or construction projects where stability and predictability are critical.

**Agile:
        Structure: Iterative, where work is done in small, incremental cycles (sprints). Allows for ongoing revisions.
        Use Case: Appropriate for dynamic, fast-changing environments like startups or software where requirements frequently evolve.
