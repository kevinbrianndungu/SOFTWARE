IDEs: Provide a unified interface for code writing, debugging, and testing. Examples include Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and PyCharm. IDEs increase productivity by offering features like code suggestions, debugging tools, and project management capabilities.

VCS: Systems like Git or SVN allow multiple developers to work on a project collaboratively without conflicts, maintaining a history of changes, and enabling rollback if issues arise. They are critical for managing large, collaborative projects.
