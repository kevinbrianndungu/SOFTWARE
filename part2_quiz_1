Prompt engineering - is the process of designing and refining input prompts to effectively interact with AI models, like GPT, to produce relevant, accurate, and useful responses

**IMPORTANCE**
Prompt engineering is crucial because AI models, like GPT, generate responses based on the input they receive. Poorly structured prompts can lead to irrelevant or inaccurate results, while well-crafted prompts ensure the AI provides more targeted, useful, and meaningful outputs. This is especially important in areas like customer support automation, content generation, and complex decision-making tasks, where precision matters.
