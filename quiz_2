1.Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s): This introduced the idea of breaking programs into smaller, manageable sections (functions or procedures). It improved code readability, maintainability, and reusability, moving away from the chaotic "spaghetti code" era.

2.Object-Oriented Programming (1970s-1980s): This paradigm shift introduced the concept of encapsulating data and behavior into objects, making it easier to model real-world entities. Languages like C++, Java, and Python have roots in this milestone.

3.Agile Development (2000s): Agile methodologies revolutionized software development by introducing iterative, incremental development and encouraging flexibility in response to changes. It allowed teams to focus on customer collaboration and early delivery.
