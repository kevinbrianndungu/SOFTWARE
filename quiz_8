Unit Testing: Involves testing individual components (functions, methods) in isolation to ensure they work as expected. Itâ€™s critical for catching bugs early in the development process.

Integration Testing: Focuses on ensuring that different modules or components of a system work together. This is important for detecting interface and interaction issues.

System Testing: Involves testing the entire system as a whole to verify that it meets the specified requirements. It's important for ensuring overall system reliability.

Acceptance Testing: Conducted to determine whether the system meets user needs and business requirements. It is often the final stage before the software is delivered to the client or end-users.
