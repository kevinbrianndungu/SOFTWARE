Vague Prompt: "How does AI work?"
Improved Prompt
Improved Prompt: "Can you explain how machine learning algorithms, like neural networks, are used in AI to identify patterns in large datasets?"
Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective
Clarity: The improved prompt specifies the aspect of AI that you're interested in—machine learning algorithms, particularly neural networks—making it easier for the AI to provide a relevant response.

Specificity: It focuses on a particular use of AI (pattern recognition in large datasets) instead of the broad concept of how AI works. This allows for a more detailed and informative explanation.

Conciseness: The improved prompt is still succinct but more precise, avoiding the ambiguity of the vague question while guiding the AI to offer a focused answer.
